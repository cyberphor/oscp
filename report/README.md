# Executive Summary
On 1 August 2021, Victor Fernandez III performed a penetration test of the Offensive Security exam network. This report includes detailed information about the vulnerabilities he discovered as well as recommendations for mitigating each of them. This report also contains an outline of the methodolgy he used to enumerate and exploit the THINC.local domain. During the penetration test, Victor was able to gain administrator-level access to multiple computers, primarly due to out-of-date and/or misconfigured software. A brief description of each computer compromised is listed below.

## Attack Vectors
| Vulnerabilities | Exploits |
| --- | ---| 
| CVE-2008-1234 | EDB-ID-56789 |
| CVE-2012-5678 | cyberphor POC |

## Recommendations
Victor recommends patching the vulnerabilities he identified to mitigate the risk of exploitation and/or unauthorized access to Offensive Security information systems. One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.

# Methodology
Victor used a widely-adopted and phased approach for the penetration test. This included reconnaissance, enumeration, gaining access, maintaining access, and covering his tracks. Below is an outline of Victor's activities and serves to demonstrate how he identified and exploited a variety of information systems across the Offensive Security exam network.

## Reconnaissance
The purpose of the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test is to identify information and sytems that represent the organization online and then, discover possible attack vectors. For this penetration test, Victor was asked to narrow his information gathering objectives to collecting the details below. 

### General Information
* Hostname: 
* Description: 
* IP Address: 
* MAC Address: (ref:) 
* Domain: WORKGROUP
* Distro: (ref:)
* Kernel: (ref:)
* Architecture: (ref:)

### Ports
```bash
# replace scan results
```

### Service Versions
```bash
# replace scan results
```

### Operating System
```bash
# replace scan results
```

## Enumeration
The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems. This is valuable for an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system. Understanding what applications are running on the system gives an attacker needed information before performing the actual penetration test. In some cases, some ports may not be listed.

### Protocol 1
```bash
# replace scan results
```

### Protocol 2
```bash
# replace scan results
```

### Protocol 3
```bash
# replace scan results
```

## Gaining Access
The penetration testing portions of the assessment focus heavily on gaining access to a variety of systems. During this penetration test, Victor was able to successfully gain access to 10 out of the 50 systems.

### Password Guessing  
#### Credentials
* Application
  * admin:admin
* Operating System
  * victor:password123

## Maintaining Access
Maintaining access to a system is important to us as attackers, ensuring that we can get back into a system after it has been exploited is invaluable. The maintaining access phase of the penetration test focuses on ensuring that once the focused attack has occurred (i.e. a buffer overflow), we have administrative access over the system again. Many exploits may only be exploitable once and we may never be able to get back into a system after we have already per-formed the exploit. Victor added administrator and root level accounts on all systems compromised. In addition to the administrative/root access, a Metasploit meterpreter service was installed on the machine to en-sure that additional access could be established.

### Privilege Escalation
```bash
# steps go here
```

## Covering Tracks
The house cleaning portions of the assessment ensures that remnants of the penetration test are removed. Often fragments of tools or user accounts are left on an organizations computer which can cause security issues down the road. Ensuring that we are meticulous and no remnants of our penetration test are left over is important. After the trophies on both the lab network and exam network were completed, Victor removed all user accounts and passwords as well as the Meterpreter services installed on the system. Offensive Security should not have to remove any user accounts or services from the system.
